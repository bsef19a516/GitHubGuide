    <h2>
    <strong>Step 1: What is Github?</strong>
</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <span>To be very crisp about what exactly is GitHub, it is a file or code-sharing service to collaborate with different people.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <span>GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.</span>
</p>
<h3><strong>Why is Github so popular?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <span>GitHub has various advantages but many people often have a doubt as to why not use dropbox or any cloud based system? Let me take the same example forward to answer this question. Say more than two software developers are working on the same file and they want to update it simultaneously. Unfortunately, the person who save the file first will get precedence over the others.&nbsp;</span><span>While in Github, this is not the case. Github document the changes and reflect them in an organized manner to avoid any chaos between any of the files uploaded.<br> Therefore using GitHub centralized repository, it avoids all the confusion and working on the same code becomes very easy.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">
    <span>Now let me list down the ways in which GitHub makes git simple:&nbsp;</span>
</p>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;"> 
        <li style="list-style-type: none;">
            <ul style="text-align: justify;"> 
                <li style="text-align: justify;">
                    <span>GitHub provides you a beautiful visual interface which helps you to track or manage your version controlled projects locally.</span>
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <span>Once you register on GitHub, you can connect with social network and build a strong profile.</span>
                </li>
            </ul> 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <a name=CreateRepository></a>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <span>So let&#8217;s get started with GitHub.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <h2>
        <span><strong>Step 2: How to create a GitHub Repository?</strong></span>
    </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <span>A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub&nbsp; or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. You need a GitHub repository when you have done some changes and are ready to be uploaded. This GitHub repository acts as your remote repository. So let me make your task easy, just follow these simple steps to create a GitHub repository:&nbsp;
        </span>
    </p>
    <ul> 
        <li style="text-align: justify;">
            <span>&nbsp;Go to the link</span>:&nbsp;<span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://github.com/ target=_blank>https://github.com/</a></span> . <span>Fill the sign up form and click on &#8220;Sign up for Github&#8221;.</span>
        </li> 
        <li style="text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;Click on &#8220;Start a new project&#8221;.</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Refer to the below screenshot to get a better understanding.</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53367  lazyload blur-up " src="ss1.png" width=1078 height=347  data-sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px">
    </p>
    <ul> 
        <li style="text-align: justify;"><span>Enter any repository name and click on &#8220;Create Repository&#8221;. You can also give a description to your repository (optional).</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53371  lazyload blur-up " src="ss2.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px"></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Now, if you noticed by default a GitHub repository is private which means that you can choose who can view the content whereas in a private repository, anyone can view the contents of this repository .&nbsp;</span><span>Also, if you refer the above screenshot, initialize the repository with a README file. This file contains the description of the file and once you check this box, this will be the first file inside your repository.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Congratulations, your repository is successfully created!</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>So now my central repository has been sucessfully created! Once this is done, you are ready to commit, pull, push and perform all the other operations.</span></p>
